Terry is without a doubt the unassuming voice of clarity. 

She’s curious, articulate, and thoughtful. She wants to understand, but more importantly she wants you to understand, too. It doesn't matter what the subject is.

Terry embodies the &yet philosophy of teaching everything we know. 

She’s passionate about both learning and teaching. This would be evident if you were to have a conversation with her, but it’s also been made obvious in her natural transition from fine art, to web design, to web development.

A highly talented developer and designer, I guarantee there’s nothing Terry can’t figure out once she’s tried it. If you were to give her a Rubik’s cube, she’d have it back to you in solid colors with an easy to follow guide of how to get there.

And you would definitely be able to do it, because Terry helped empower you to.

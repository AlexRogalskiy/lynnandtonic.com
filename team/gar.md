A long-time colleague of many a yeti, Michael Garvin was added to the team through the arduous process of finally accepting our repeated invitation.

Affectionately known as “Gar”, he learned early on that the key to success in the web game was to stay current on languages. A versatile collector of languages, he has become highly adept in Python, Ruby, C, and assembler, though he admits to enjoying JavaScript quite a bit more now due to Node. He also has considerable experience building with Rails.

An all-around kickass addition, Gar brings a depth of experience to the team.

Acknowledged by his peers as an outstanding engineer, Gar also possesses so unique a creative force that he once fused an old school Nintendo controller to his computer just so he could program with it.

It’s this same type of ingenuity that led him to create and publish one of the first projects written on Strophe.js (a feature-complete browser-based IM client) and finish it in a two-week span, just for the sake of doing it.

When he’s away from the keyboard, you’ll find him adding to his series of videos starring his dearest friend.

Philip is a professional agonizer.

We met him through his insightful [blog posts](http://latentflip.com) and painfully honest [tweets](http://twitter.com/philip_roberts), and really got to know him at [Brio](http://brioconference.com), [RealtimeConf EU](http://realtimeconf.eu), and [TriConf](http://triconf.com).

Phil’s JavaScript is first-class, his approach to solving hard problems is relentless, and his insistence on code simplicity is admirable, but it’s his huge heart that won us over.

Ask Philip about his days as an Electrical Engineer blackbox reverse-engineering a new audio chip for the Xbox 360 and you’ll see where he got the tenacious ability to pursue a particularly stubborn software glitch until identifying it as a browser bug.

Watch him pound out code at a rate aproaching >300WPM and you’ll be certain you’re watching the flailings of a madman—until you see the product of his craft.

But hear him reflect on the problems of society and individuals (including himself) and you’ll know you're speaking to someone with tremendous character and who truly *cares*.

Once called [The Steve Jobs of Functional Reactive Programming](https://twitter.com/paddyforan/status/338301944537952256), Philip’s given highly engaging and educational presentations at RealtimeConf EU, Scotland JS, Northern Lights, and more. Our local community was proud to have him as one of our closing keynotes for [TriConf](http://triconf.com). He’s heavily involved in Edinburgh’s software community, as one of the organizers of [TechMeetup](http://techmeetup.co.uk) and a resident of [TechCube](http://techcu.be).

Before joining &yet, he bootstrapped and co-founded [Float](http://floatapp.com), an app which helps small businesses simply manage cash flow. Before that, he was a DJ long enough to win the sympathy and later admiration of his dear wife—and never. spun. again.

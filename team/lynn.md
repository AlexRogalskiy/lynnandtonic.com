Have you met Lynn? If not, you should totally hang out with her sometime. I mean, not just because she’s totally cool (because she is, I have proven it with science), but because she is the very Platonic Ideal of &yet’s “What the heck, why not?” philosophy. Seriously. You have an idea? Want to make it happen? Lynn is all about it. Her middle name is Collaboration.<sup>*</sup>

But long before she became le grand collaborateur that she is today, Lynn got her start designing web sites for local bands in her beloved Arizona. And, after having realized that being a design virtuoso was kind of fun, she went on to study the fine arts, animation, painting and sculpture.<sup>†</sup>

Now a full-fledged Yeti<sup>‡</sup>, Lynn brings her comprehensive design talent to bear<sup>§</sup> with her skills in interface design, HTML/CSS, graphics, and illustration<sup>‖</sup>, which incidentally blurs the line between designer and developer in a very cool way. 

When Lynn is not making the webs look beautiful, she likes painting, playing tabletop games, and owning at team trivia.

<sup>‡</sup> Can you use “fledge” with a yeti? Or would it be a pelt thing?

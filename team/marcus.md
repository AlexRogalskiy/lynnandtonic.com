Incredibly tall and equally kind—yep, that’s pretty much Marcus in a nutshell.  Since joining the Ops team at &yet, Marcus has done nothing but wow us with his eagerness to help the team and his passion for solving very (very (very)) hard problems. He’s the reason our developers can sleep a little more peacefully at night.

Some might call it a compulsion, but I’d argue it’s passion that compels Marcus to make applications and websites stable, performant and secure. He has worked with many languages, frameworks and open-source software packages, and prides himself on being able to quickly learn and master new technologies. Folks, this guy is “kind of fast” like the universe is “kind of a big place.”

And if that weren’t enough, Marcus is a true example to the team on how that whole personal growth thing is supposed to work. He is continually learning and improving his knowledge, which in turn inspires the entire team to do—and be—better. 

Marcus hails from the great land of Minden, Canada, where he lives with his lovely wife and two darling boys. If he isn’t busy wearing his ops superhero cape, you can find him enjoying the lake or hanging out at the playground, professional dad style. As you may well guess, he’s a fan of swimming and fishing, and he’s even got plans to build a wooden boat someday (which you know is totally going to happen).

Don't you want to be friends with Marcus? We’re pretty darn lucky to have him as a fellow yeti. Two goals Marcus shared when he first joined the team were to be more patient and to be happier, two things he’s helping our team—and the whole dang world—improve upon.

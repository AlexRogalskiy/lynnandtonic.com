When you first meet Jaime, you might think, “Wow. That is a nice guy.”

And you’d be right. But what you’d be missing is the intense river of sheer awesome that flows like a river under his placid surface.

Jaime and Adam met a few years ago, back when J was still a high-schooler casting about for a life plan. He’d seen the things that the world had to offer him, and he knew one thing: he wouldn’t be satisfied with any kind of workaday humdrum. He was ronin. Leaderless. Wandering the land.

Skip ahead some years (years!), and now Jaime is an indispensable part of the team. His art skillz are nonpareil. You want a comic book based upon a novel? He can do that (and has). Jaime can paint. Jaime can illustrate. Jaime understands the weird alchemy of freezing a moment in amber for all to enjoy. He can Wacom with the best of them.

Like the ronin, Jaime knows that the best style is NO style.

But the coolest thing about Jaime is that he fuels his artistic career with sheer gumption. Because instead of having been born with some Leonardo-esque preternatural skill, Jaime just goes out there and does art every. Single. Day. He draws all day. When he isn’t drawing, he paints. When he isn’t painting? He studies drawing. And painting. And when he's not doing those things? He's being the [very best example](http://vimeo.com/113239632) to the next generation. 

We’re proud to have Jaime as part of our art and design team. The ronin has found a home. Meet Jaime Robles: art samurai.

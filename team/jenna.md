Filmmaker and storyteller is a pretty accurate description of Jenna. But truly, she is so much more. Deeply caring, passionate, determined, hilarious, quick to learn, business savvy, I could go on for literal days. She also has an artist’s eye and a knack for perfectly communicating deep feeling through imagery, be it still or in motion. 

As the creative wizard behind &yet video production as well as the supreme master of social media, there isn’t much Jenna can’t do. Oh, and have I mentioned that Jenna also leads &yet's latest adventure, [MUX](http://mux.tc/), a monthly mini music festival that’s building a more vibrant music scene in the Tri-Cities by promoting local bands and pairing them with brilliant out-of-towners? Because she is. Does this make her good at all the things? 

Spoiler alert: yes. 

Something you might not know about Jenna is that she knows coffee. Seriously, I’m not joking, she really knows coffee. As a pair of coffee aficionados, she and her darling husband own our favorite coffee shop in all of Tri-Cities, which is a real distinction if you know anything about our legendary love for java. If a yeti isn’t at &yet headquarters, chances are good you can find them sipping espresso and noshing on tasty pastries at [The Local](http://www.wearethelocal.com/#about-1). 

In addition to her husband, the number one love in her life, Jenna loves things that are purple and every cat in the world. But don’t tell Vivian, she might get jealous.

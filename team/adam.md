Adam doesn’t like titles, which is good because if he did, he’d be stuck with, “Copywriter/Developer/Designer/Owner/Sandwich Maker/Psychologist/High Fiverer,” which is really difficult to fit on one of those decorative desk plaques. 

And to make matters worse, he doesn’t like to draw attention to himself. Like, if I said to you that he is the original Yeti, and that he helped build &yet from the ground up into something strange and wond’rous, he would tell me to give the credit to a bunch of other people. 

And, like, if I were to say that he has this rare talent of finding talented people, putting them in an ideal environment, and then helping them to grow into the absolute best possible version of themselves, he would probably ask me to stop doing that and to please get out of his office (which, incidentally, is exactly the same size as everybody else’s office). 

So really I won’t say any of those things. Instead, I’m just gonna say that Adam is a pretty cool cat who likes to dance with his kids (when he’s not telling them to “Go do art!”), read good books, listen to piles of music, and play fantasy baseball as hard as he can until he gets bored and forgets about it for months.

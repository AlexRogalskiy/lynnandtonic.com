    .intro

      p I’m #[strong Lynn Fisher], an artist, designer, and developer. I work with some of my very favorite people at #[a(href='https://andyet.com') &yet], where I serve as their Chief Creative Officer and make cool things for the web.
      p I live and work in #[a(href='http://why.az') Arizona] with my husband Clay and our two pups, #[a(href='https://www.instagram.com/p/BmdmiINBnCs/') Boomer] and #[a(href='https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ7W7rtgvmW/') Helo]. I love a good musical, superhero movie, and game of team trivia.
      p I’m available for hire on a very limited basis for fun things like illustration, hard CSS bugs, and custom sugar cookies.

    h1 CSSDay Talk: Illustration with CSS

    p In December I gave a talk at [CSSDay](http://cssday.io/) in Chandler, AZ. It focused on CSS illustration and my recent [A Single Div](http://a.singlediv.com) project. It was an awesome one-day event and I hope there will be more like it in the future. I love me some CSS conferences, especially ones in my home town!

    p Here’s the video and slides for my talk. The rest of the talks (many of which were just wonderful) can be seen here: #[a(href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYymXZtpU0g&feature=youtu.be&list=PLfWvsMtBxHo1WqPrBwxq3zc2RDo5HkYwy') CSSDay Talks playlist on Youtube].

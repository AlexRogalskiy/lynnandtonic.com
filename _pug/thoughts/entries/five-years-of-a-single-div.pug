    :markdown-it
      On 22 May 2014, I publish a little camera illustration. It’s drawn with CSS and one HTML element (a div).

      With this, my favorite little side project is born.

      I draw some food, a Captain America shield, and an iPhone battery. CSS solidifies itself as my favorite artistic medium.

      With each drawing, I share a tweet. People seem to really dig it. It encourages me to keep going.

      I give the project a name and buy [a domain](https://a.singlediv.com).

      Mozilla Hacks invites me to [write a tutorial](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/single-div-drawings-with-css/).

      My web heroes see the project, share it, and praise it. I can’t believe it. I’m positively glowing 😻.

      A Single Div hits Reddit and Hacker News. It’s exciting and horrible at the same time. It inspires my favorite tagline: I specialize in projects that make people say “I don’t get it.”

      The drawings become more complex as I try out new techniques and find new challenges.

      A Single Div is featured in Net Magazine. I’m beside myself with joy.

      People holler at me about SVG. This seems to hold even for my projects that follow. Something [I can joke about](https://a.singlediv.com/#svg) fondly now. Yes, I’ve heard of SVG.

      I give a talk on [CSS illustration at CSSDay](/thoughts/entries/talk-illustration-with-css/). I share A Single Div and talk about art with a bunch of developers. I’m holding on to this high.

      A Single Div becomes a project I can work on even when I’m feeling stuck. A few hours here or there and the site continues to grow.

      I learn *so much* about CSS behavior. I grow a deep, mental reference I can pull from for my job and paid projects. “Real” projects as people often say. But truly, what project isn’t real?

      I test the limits of my creativity. The constraints help me to see things differently. And to see *myself* differently. “Can I draw this?” feels like “Gosh, I don’t think I can.” But with enough thinking, it shifts to “Holy crap, it works.” Honestly I still look back at some of these drawings and wonder how the heck I did that.

      I’ve learned so much from you, little side project. Happy fifth anniversary (I heard the traditional gift is wood 👇).

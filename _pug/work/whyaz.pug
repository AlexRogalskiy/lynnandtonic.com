    p WhyAZ is a little web project that resulted from asking questions about attracting and keeping talent in Arizona. We spend a lot of time building up and promoting our brands and projects, but we spend little time talking about Arizona. Our state has a lot to offer and so #[a(href='http://why.az') why.az] was born.
    p To make it even more fun, I thought it might be neat if we designed the site completely in browser, drawing our graphical elements in CSS while maintaining clean, semantic markup.
    p To read more about the approach, check out this blog post: #[a(href='http://blog.meltmedia.com/2013/08/why-whyaz/') Why WhyAZ?]
    p At the time of that post, each illustration consisted of two HTML elements. But now, each illustration is one glorious single div.
    p To see the many many examples we've made (and to learn more about our great state), visit #[a(href='http://why.az') why.az].
